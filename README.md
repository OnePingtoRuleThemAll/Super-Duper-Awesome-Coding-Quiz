### Credits: 
I relied a lot on watching several youtube walk throughs and of course the weekly content from class lessons. Ethan was very helpful with his mock up that he helped talk us through on Monday evening. 

Some of the links youtube videos I referred to were: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQr4O1OITJo, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqddbIrEM5I

I used google fonts to import that into the application
